### Routing Section Intro

Routing in a React app

* Install a third party package
* routes.js file to configure the routes
* For each route, create a component file, export the component, import it in routes.js and configure the new route with a path property

Typically seting up routing in a react application 

Installing a third-party package like react router 

We would then create a routes.js file where we configure the routes for our application, for every route we would create a component file export the component 
import it in routes.js and configure the new route with a path property

As opposed to configuring the routing feature by writing some code next js decided to adopt a file system based routing mechanism
 
The convention or the guideline is that when a file is added to the pages folder in the project it automatically becomes available as a route and by mixing and
matching file names with nested folder structure. 

Routing in a Next.js app

* File-system based routing mechanism
* When a file is added to the pages folder in a project, it automatically becomes available as a
route
* By mixing and matching file names with a nested folder structure, it is possible to pretty much define the most common routing patterns.

Routing in a Next.js app

* Route with Pages
* Nested routes
* Dynamic routes
* Catch-all routes
* Navigate from the UI
* Programmatically navigate b/w Pages
